It has never been more challenging to be a parent -- or more hazardous to be a child. In Five Needs Your Child Must Have Met at Home, Ron Hutchcraft presents a practical roadmap for how to raise stable children in an unstable world. No matter how far you are on the parenting road, Hutchcraft can show you how to make the most of the days you have left with your children. Five Needs Your Child Must Have Met at Home details the five critical needs of every child: the need for a secure self, honest sexual answers, satisfying love, stable authority, and spiritual reality. You'll learn: how to identify and affirm your children's strengths, how to look beyond you children's deeds to meet their needs, and how to raise children of integrity.\",\n          \"A writer renowned for his insight into the mysteries of the body now gives us a lambent and profoundly moving book about the mysteries of family. At its center lies Sherwin Nuland\\u2019s Rembrandtesque portrait of his father, Meyer Nudelman, a Jewish garment  worker who came to America in the early years of the last century but remained an eternal outsider. Awkward in speech and movement, broken by the premature deaths of a wife and child, Meyer ruled his youngest son with a regime of rage, dependency, and helpless love that outlasted his death. In evoking their relationship, Nuland also summons up the warmth and claustrophobia of a vanished immigrant New York, a world that impelled its children toward success yet made them feel like traitors for leaving it behind. Full of feeling and unwavering observation, Lost in America deserves a place alongside such classics as Patrimony and Call It Sleep.\",\n          \"Provides a wealth of information on the sport of hiking, lists 387 hiking areas state-by-state, and rates the major trails according to terrain, visual beauty, and degree of difficulty\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Closer to the truth, they suggest, is the realisation that scientific certainty comes from interpreting ambiguous results within an order imposed by scientists themselves.

At the first level, the individual scientist makes observations, formulates hypotheses, and does experiments.  The scientist's thought style determines what can be seen and what it will appear to mean.  At the second level, scientists participate in social institutions such as graduate programs, research groups, journal editorial boards, and grant review panels.

These are just a few of the 65 projects in this engaging book created by the prestigious Ontario Science Centre that will enable children to experience and enjoy science—as they’re learning about it.Many of these easy-to-perform experiments are presented as puzzles or tricks, each representing one of the fundamental principles of science. Others present complex phenomena on a small, observable scale. For example, kids will discover why icebergs float and where the wind gets its strength. They’ll construct a camera, support a stack of books on mere eggshells, and life a floating ice cube out of a glass of water by using just one end of a piece of string. And there’s much more.Each project is explained in clear step-by-step instructions and humorous drawings, and it ends with a word on the scientific forces at work. And most important, none of the experiments requires sophisticated equipment—only some curiosity and a few everyday household items. Parents will find these activities as amusing and intriguing as their kids—as they find out together how science works.'),\n",

Its subjects range across the spectrum of physical science, from the monumental - the Superconducting Super Collider and the Big Bang - to the enigmatic, such as crystals with impossible structures and the quest for the absolute zero of temperature. The drama of scientific research, the thoughts and feelings of its practitioners, the thrill of discovery, and the indomitable human urge to conquer the unknown form the rich background for the search for meaning that unites scientists and nonscientists alike.With wit and incisive intelligence the author pursues his central question: what do the breakthroughs and revolutionary insights at the cutting edge of science mean for ordinary people? In the course of this pursuit he explores the lessons that Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi's style of research teach us about the art of living, shows how CAT scans illustrate Richard Feynman's definition of the scientific method, and points out the visible clues for Einstein's theory of relativity that can be found in amusement parks. His fresh and illuminating images are drawn from the world of literature as often as from children's playgrounds and from daily life.\"),\n",

Despite marked public interest, many leading scientists remain skeptical that there is much common ground between scientific knowledge and religious belief. Indeed, they are often antagonistic. Can an accommodation be reached after centuries of conflict?In this stimulating collection of articles on the subject, Paul Kurtz, with the assistance of Barry Karr and Ranjit Sandhu, have assembled the thoughts of scientists from various disciplines. Among the distinguished contributors are Sir Arthur C. Clarke (author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and numerous other works of science fiction); Nobel Prize Laureate Steven Weinberg (professor of physics at the University of Texas at Austin); Neil deGrasse Tyson (Princeton University astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium); James Lovelock (creator of the Gaia hypothesis); Kendrick Frazier (editor of the Skeptical Inquirer); Steven Pinker (professor of psychology at MIT); Richard Dawkins (zoologist at Oxford University); Eugenie Scott (physical anthropologist and executive director of the National Center for Science Education); Owen Gingerich (professor of astronomy at Harvard University); Martin Gardner (prolific popular science writer); the late Richard Feynman (Nobel Prize-winning physicist) and Stephen Jay Gould (professor of geology at Harvard University); and many other eminent scientists and scholars.Among the topics discussed are the Big Bang and the origin of the universe, intelligent design and creationism versus evolution, the nature of the \"soul,\" near-death experiences, communication with the dead, why people do or do not believe in God, and the relationship between religion and ethics.'),\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
